                <p>The solar system is the vast region of space dominated by the Sun and everything bound to it by gravity. It includes eight planets—Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune—along with their moons, asteroids, comets, and dwarf planets like Pluto. Formed about 4.6 billion years ago from a rotating cloud of gas and dust, the solar system is organized with rocky planets closer to the Sun and gas and ice giants farther away. At its center, the Sun provides the light and energy that sustain life on Earth. Beyond Neptune lies the Kuiper Belt and the distant Oort Cloud, where countless icy bodies orbit. The solar system is our cosmic neighborhood, a small but wondrous part of the vast universe.</p>

            <h3><span class="sub">(13.8 Billion Years Ago)</span><br>Big Bang</h3>
            <p>The Big Bang is the beginning of the universe. About 13.8 billion years ago, everything was very hot and dense. Suddenly, space started expanding in all directions. This expansion created time, space, energy, and matter.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="t2">
            <h3><span class="sub">(First Few Seconds)</span><br>Early Universe </h3>
            <p>Just after the Big Bang, the universe was extremely hot. There were no stars, planets, or galaxies at that time. The universe was filled only with energy and tiny particles. Slowly, it started cooling down.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="t3">
            <h3><span class="sub"> (First 3 Minutes)</span><br>Formation of Particles</h3>
            <p>As the universe cooled, energy changed into matter. Small particles like protons, neutrons, and electrons were formed. These particles are the basic building blocks of matter. They later helped in forming atoms.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="t4">
            <h3><span class="sub">(380,000 Years After Big Bang)</span><br>Formation of Atoms</h3>
            <p>After some time, particles joined together to form atoms. Hydrogen and helium were the first atoms created. Light could now travel freely through space. The universe became clearer and darker often called the "Dark Ages" before stars lit up.</p>

        <div class="t5">
            <h3><span class="sub">(~400 Million Years After Big Bang)</span><br>First Stars</h3>
            <p>Gravity pulled large clouds of gas together. These clouds became very hot and formed the first stars. Stars produced light and heat. Inside stars, heavier elements were created.</p>

        <div class="t6">
            <h3><span class="sub">(~1 Billion Years After Big Bang)</span><br>Formation of Galaxies</h3>
            <p>Stars grouped together to form galaxies. A galaxy contains billions of stars. Our home galaxy is called the Milky Way. Galaxies spread throughout the universe.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="t7">
            <h3><span class="sub">(4.6 Billion Years Ago)</span><br>Solar System Formation</h3>
            <p>About 4.6 billion years ago, the Sun was formed. Planets formed around the Sun from dust and gas. Earth is one of these planets. This system is called the solar system.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="t8">
            <h3><span class="sub">(~3.8 Billion Years Ago)</span><br>Earth and Life</h3>
            <p>Earth slowly cooled down after its formation. Water appeared on the surface of Earth. Simple life forms developed in water. Over time, life became more complex.</p>

        <div class="t9">
            <h3><span class="sub">(Now)</span><br>Present Universe</h3>
            <p>Today, the universe has billions of galaxies and stars. Planets, moons, and other space objects exist everywhere. The universe is still expanding. Scientists continue to study space.</p>

            <h3><span class="sub">(Billions of Years from Now)</span><br>Future of the Universe</h3>
            <p>In the future, stars will slowly lose their energy. Galaxies may move farther apart due to the expansion of the universe. The universe will become colder and darker. Fewer new stars will be formed.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="t11">
            <h3><span class="sub">(Trillions of Years from Now)</span><br>End of the Universe</h3>
            <p>One possible end is called the Big Freeze or Heat Death. In this case, all stars burn out completely. The universe becomes dark, cold, and silent. Everything slowly fades away.</p>
