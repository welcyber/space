                <h2>Solar System</h2>
                <p>The solar system is the vast region of space dominated by the Sun and everything bound to it by gravity. It includes eight planets—Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune—along with their moons, asteroids, comets, and dwarf planets like Pluto. Formed about 4.6 billion years ago from a rotating cloud of gas and dust, the solar system is organized with rocky planets closer to the Sun and gas and ice giants farther away. At its center, the Sun provides the light and energy that sustain life on Earth. Beyond Neptune lies the Kuiper Belt and the distant Oort Cloud, where countless icy bodies orbit. The solar system is our cosmic neighborhood, a small but wondrous part of the vast universe.</p>

Surface temperatures swing from –180 °C at night to +430 °C in sunlight. 
Its year lasts just 88 Earth days, and it has no moons.

                <p>A supernova is a powerful and spectacular explosion that marks the end of a massive star’s life cycle. When a star exhausts its nuclear fuel, its core collapses under gravity, releasing an enormous burst of energy that outshines entire galaxies for a short time. These explosions scatter heavy elements like iron, gold, and oxygen into space, enriching the universe and contributing to the formation of new stars and planets. </p>

Formed billions of years ago, likely from debris after a massive collision, the Moon’s surface is covered with craters, mountains, and plains of solidified lava called maria. It has no atmosphere, weather, or liquid water, but its surface holds valuable clues about the early solar system. </p>
